# A Big Blue Green World

In this diverse, amazing and vast world, there are a variety of different naturally occurring beauties and marvels which can be admired. From the glistening Caribbean ocean to the snow-capped Himalayan Mountains, these things are awe-inspiring and bring about emotions. This is a world where Bootstrap 5 or other UI Frameworks have been embedded into it. 



## A Big #0000FF #00FF00 Hellish landscape

Hypothetically speaking, if this world was made with no UI Framework, the consequences would be unthinkable. Those glistening turquoise oceans would be turned into #0000FF rectangles with fish appearing either above, below, or to the side of it. Those breathtaking mountains would just be varying sizes of rectangles, egregiously looming over the landscape. Although many people, including me, don’t actually take the time in their day-to-day life to revere the beauty of nature, it is painfully clear when there is something polluting the view. This is the same case with these disgusting websites. A nice looking website most likely won’t get noticed by most people who don’t really design websites. However, when a search bar is not on the top right or top left of a website, or when the logo at the top of the screen doesn’t take the user to the home page, it becomes painfully clear that something has plagued the website. As more and more people grow up with technology, it becomes increasingly that there is a pattern or maybe even an implicit standard that is upheld when making a website.



## Government Contractors are the Enemy

This is my rant against government contractors who make websites. After speed-running the HTML course from freecodeacademy, I realized that government contractors who make websites are the most incapable, or maybe even maliciously compliant leeches I have ever not gotten the misfortune of seeing ever. These parasites are the bane of my existence. Forcing tens of thousands of employees to undergo the most gruesome trainings, locked behind jarring walls of html which stretch from the left to the right end of the screen. Why can’t they just put padding on the training page, which is required ANNUALLY. Although I have not enjoyed spending 2 hours trying to align the right side of my navbar to the left side of my navbar, I will continue doing my due diligence in not being a salary paid-level website developer. Learning about UI Frameworks has made me respect the amount of effort put in by frontend developers in making everything look nice which often go overlooked. The subtleties in the slightly darker font became apparent when I would tab back and forth between my imitation and the real thing. Although the one thing I will say is that it is nice being able to see how removing certain parts of the html will affect the webpage in real time. I can confidently say that even though I will never be the best at making things look good, I will never be close to the worst.
