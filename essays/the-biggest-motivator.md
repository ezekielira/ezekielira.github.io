# The Biggest Motivator
When I was a fifth grader, I remember seeing my classmates show-off the new Ipads and Iphones that their parents had bought them. Being the kid that I was, I mistakenly asked my parents if I could have an Ipad too. Being a first generation immigrant living in a multi-generational household with five kids and 2 grandparents, the answer pretty much shaped the way I thought about the world at the ripe age of 12. 

*“What do you mean you want an Ipad? Do you know how expensive those are? We have no money to afford that and it’s none of your business to compare our living standards with other families. You should just be grateful that we even have the opportunity to come to America in the first place. We work hard everyday for you to study, succeed, get scholarships, and go to college.”*

Aside from not ever asking my parents for anything ever again, I realized that I had to get money somehow. 

## I Guess I Can Study That
Since I was in middle school I knew I wouldn’t actually have money for college, I would probably have to sell my soul to the government first to gain those rights. So for school I just took whatever classes my friends took, which happened to be all AP classes. This is when I realized that I was pretty good at problem solving and STEM subjects. When my friends eventually graduated while I slaved away for the Military Industrial Complex, they all got offers for 6 digit salary jobs straight out of college. That’s when I asked my friend what he studied and he gave me a brief description of Data Science. It seemed like something that I would be good at and wouldn't mind doing so... That’s when I decided: *“Well, I guess I can study that.”*

## Stockholm Syndrome
After going through some Computer Science classes I'm not really sure if I enjoy any aspect of it at all. However I will admit, the single most satisfying thing that I have ever experienced in my academic career has been debugging successfully and getting the correct output. I get so annoyed when I code sometimes, since it's like I'm talking to a toddler who wants to argue semantics. However nothing really beats that feeling of finally getting the desired result. It's almost obsessive how I will rot away at my chair trying to figure out how to get something to work. Being alone on my computer on my desk while my family is asleep late at night knowing that I have to wake up in 5 hours is demotivating, but I want my son to be able to go to college. I want to be able to tell him to study what he wants to. This alone is enough for me to continue with being held hostage by this cursed profession. But whenever I look back at my past projects, I say to myself *"Well I mean, it wasn't that bad I guess.."*
