Since I had no money to go to college and I didn't want to go into debt I did what the U.S government incentivized people like me to do and joined the military so as to take advantage of the G.I Bill, which is essentially a benefit granting U.S military/veterans free college. I didn't really care what job I had in the Military Industrial Complex at first, but since language learning is one of my biggest hobbies and I had plenty of Chinese-Heritage friends, I decided to aim to become a linguist through the military. 

After graduating from Bootcamp they sent me to Monterey, California and had me learn Chinese from zero. This is how the course was laid out: 64 weeks, every week 5 days, every day 8 hours of pure Chinese fun!! On top of all of that, there was homework which was expected to last over 2 hours everyday. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into, but it was one of the most experiences I've had. The learning aspect wasn't really too hard for me, but people dropped like flies and got kicked out frequently. Eventually I did end up graduating with honors and with an AA degree in Chinese. I would include a picture of me graduating but I don't want to dox my teachers, so here's a chinese proverb instead. 人山人海 （people mountain people ocean).
